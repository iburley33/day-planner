Day Planner
 
## Description
Technology used
1. html
2. css
3. js

## Purpose
Day planner with flexible UI that changes based on time of day.

## Challenges 
This project was actually very smoothe and I impressed myself with a lot of the logic for the build, as all of my ideas worked, however it took some time to translate each idea to jquery. In the end I felt like this project was the first time i really felt like I knew what I was doing without having to google every single line of code 10 times.
